## How to install the plugin
Please follow the steps to install DoubleHelix first. Despite the plugin has a dependency to `doublehelix` and will install it automatically if not present, there are custom steps that are needed on some OS.

Once done, install the plug-in with:

```
pip install doublehelix-{{project_slug}}
helix
```
